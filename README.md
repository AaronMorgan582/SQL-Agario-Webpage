# SQL-Agario-Webpage

This repository contains the code for an assignment that I worked on with Xavier Davis during the Spring 2020 term.

The C# code within establishes an incredibly basic HTML page that displays data found within a database; the data from that database is gathered via SQL commands.

There is another README file found within the root folder, which details the assignment further, including some time estimates and some of the issues that we ran into
as we finished the project.
